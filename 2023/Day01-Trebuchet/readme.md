# SUMMARY
The calibration document has ben amended...\
Each line of text contains a specific calibration value.
The value is found by:
- Combining the **first_digit** and the **last_digit**
        to form a two-digit number.

Example:
```
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```
Becomes: 12, 38, 15, 77 and therefore... 
`Expected output: 142`
# PART TWO 
I should also check for the digits written as words. (one, two...)
