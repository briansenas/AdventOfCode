# SUMMARY
I'm at Snow Island...long walk.. elf invites us to play a game...
Elf has a bag with small cubes... red, green or blue.
He will hide a secret amount of cubes in the bag.
He will show a handful of cubes couple times:
```
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
``` 
Which games would have been possible if the bag contained
ONLY 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?\
`Expected output: 8`
# PART TWO
The power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of
red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together.
The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48.
In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively.
Add up all the power cube of the minimun set of each game.
`Expected output: 2286`
