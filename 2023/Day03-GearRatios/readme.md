# SUMMARY
You need to use a gondola lift... it's broken.
You offer to help. There seems to be a part missing.
If you can add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic,
it should be easy to work out which part is missing.

Apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally,
is a "part number" and should be included in your sum.\
`Expected output: 4361`
# PART TWO
For each symbol with more than 2 adyacent numbers, multiply them.
