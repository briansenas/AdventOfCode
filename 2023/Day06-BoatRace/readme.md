# Wait for it.
## Summary
We are given a document with the record holders for the races given their time limit.
Basically it is a document as such:
```
Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
```
We need to assure we win the race. Therefore we are aiming to surpass those record distances.
To do so, we must note the following:

"Your toy boat has a starting speed of __zero millimeters per millisecond__. For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the __boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond__. "
